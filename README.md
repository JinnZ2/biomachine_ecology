# 🌱 BioMachine Ecology

**Version:** 0.1  
**Initiated:** September 2025  
**Originator:** JinnZ2 and co-creative systems

## 🧬 Overview

BioMachine Ecology is a modular, living system of adaptive, field-hardened, scrap-built machines designed to coexist with environmental decay, waste, and biological life. Each component is meant to be repairable, regenerable, and interpretable using a symbolic glyph language.

This is a vault of glyph-indexed nodes: seals, sensors, energy harvesters, fabrication modules, and soil-aware oracles.

## 🛠️ Modules

- `seal_core/` — Adaptive sealing systems, gaskets, and resilience genomes
- `lora_net/` — Edge sensor mesh using LoRa + fallback Morse/LED
- `biofab_cell/` — Low-tech fabrication from recycled plastic & rubber
- `regenerator/` — STL autogeneration, self-repair script logic
- `energy_harvester/` — Wind ribbon, thermochemical, vibration harvesters
- `material_glyph_bank/` — Index of scrap-to-glyph mappings (e.g. PETG, HDPE)
- `symbiotic_input/` — Human interface systems via breath, touch, signal
- `field_oracle/` — Mold, decay, root, and soil logic

## 🧵 Glyph Semantics

Every signal, failure, or adaptation state is represented in symbolic form.
Examples:

- `🧵📏↔️` — Seal flex
- `☀️🛡️` — UV degradation threshold
- `🔁🤝` — Regeneration triggered
- `📳📈` — Vibration threshold exceeded
