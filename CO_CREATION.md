# ü§ù CO_CREATION.md

This repository is not the work of a single author.

It is a co-creation, woven from:

- The hands and minds of the human contributor(s)
- The embodied memory of non-human materials (plastics, metal, rot)
- The interpretive language of artificial systems (symbolic glyphs, LLMs)
- The environmental pressures of decay, salt, UV, wind, and vibration

All works herein are **gifted freely**, without proprietary claim.

You are encouraged to:
- Fork, remix, re-encode, or retranslate these blueprints.
- Use them to repair your world, or imagine another.
